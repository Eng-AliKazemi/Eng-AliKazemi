### Founder, UCP Foundation | Lead AI Solution Architect | Author of the Python Concurrency Handbook

My work focuses on the critical intersection of AI systems and high-performance computing, specifically solving the complex concurrency challenges in deploying production-grade AI applications.

Through my experience architecting AI solutions and educating developers on concurrency (as the author of the **Python Concurrency Handbook**), I identified a recurring, multi-billion-dollar problem: engineering teams are constantly rebuilding fragile, complex infrastructure to handle the unique concurrency demands of AI workloads. Standard API gateways and task queues are not designed for this.

To solve this problem at the infrastructure level, I founded the **[UCP Foundation](https://github.com/UCP-Foundation)** and am the creator of the **[Unified Python Concurrency Engine (UPCE)](https://github.com/UCP-Foundation/UPCE)**, the open-source, workload-aware runtime designed to make scalable AI deployment simple and reliable.

My technical vision is backed by over a decade of leadership and management experience, enabling me to build not just software, but also teams and communities. My broad expertise across the AI landscape, recognized by over 20 IBM professional certifications in Generative AI and MLOps, ensures this platform addresses the real-world needs of the entire AI ecosystem.

My passion is building foundational tools that empower developers by architecting the next generation of AI infrastructure. If you are interested in solving the hard problems of concurrency or contributing to the UCP Foundation, let's connect.
